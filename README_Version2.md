# Aviator Prediction UI

A simple HTML/CSS/JS mockup for Aviator-style crash prediction and betting interface supporting multiple platforms (BETIKA, ODI, SHABIKI, SPORTPESA).

## Features
- Separate UI for each platform with unique selectors for easy scraping, automation, or extension
- Responsive layout
- Interactive amount controls (demo)
- Semantic selectors for prediction scripts and bots

## Usage

1. **Clone this repo**
2. **Open `index.html` in your browser**  
   (No build step required! Everything is client-side.)
3. **Customize**  
   - Edit `style.css` for colors and layout
   - Edit `script.js` for interactivity, prediction logic, or scraping
   - Add more platforms as needed

## File structure

```plaintext
index.html      # Main UI
style.css       # Styles
script.js       # Interactivity, selectors demo
README.md       # Docs

## Extending
